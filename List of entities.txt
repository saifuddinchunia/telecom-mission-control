13. Rule
A rule or number of rules help define a policy in varying degrees of granularity.  The conditions attribute stores various parameters in a JSONB sructure. This helps us keep the parameter list flexible and make it future-proof without the need to update the DB schema each time there is a change in the parameters. Each parameter like roles, work location, OS supported, carrirers supported etc can be thought of operands in logical AND operation. Each value in parameter can be a logical OR operand in the condition. For example the condtion has {roles: ['manager', 'executive'], work_locations: ["san francisco", "houston"]}, then the rule will apply to managers or executives who live in either san francisco or houston.
